collection: publications
permalink: /publication/scarlet-rot
excerpt: 'This forthcoming chapter explores the lore-crafting community of Elden Ring and their use of realism, particularly through amateur mycological analysis, to enhance the game‚Äôs world-building, focusing on the Scarlet Rot blight and its fungal manifestations. By examining fan-produced paratexts, it reveals how these interpretations reflect broader cultural anxieties about decay, environmental collapse, and cosmic horror.'
