excerpt: 'The curatorial essay for <i>Object Gardens</i>, an exhibition of ecocritical game art installations that I curated at PAVED Arts in Saskatoon in the summer of 2023 featuring the work of Peter Burr, Anna Eyler and Nicolas Lapointe, and Jakob Kudsk Steensen. Theoretically, the exhibition was inspired in large part by the recent texts by figures like Donna Haraway, Timothy Morton, and Jeff Vandermeer.'

<b>Abstract:</b> <i>Object Gardens</i> is a collection of recent media art that explores the environments that we choose to immerse ourselves within when navigating the landscapes of technoculture. More specifically, this exhibition brings together the work of Peter Burr, Anna Eyler and Nicolas Lapointe, and Jakob Kudsk Steensen to playfully interrogate the ecocritical concept of ‚Äúhyperobjects‚Äù through the lenses of digital worldbuilding and art.

For those unfamiliar, a hyperobject is a term coined by philosopher Timothy Morton [1] to describe environmental phenomena that transcend a human-centric understanding of the world. These complex systems often function across vast spatial and temporal scales and can include seemingly incomprehensible and apocalyptic processes like extinction, black holes, climate change, and radiation. In effect, hyperobjects challenge our traditional ways of thinking about the environment, exposing the limitations of our individualistic and anthropocentric worldview.

Within this theoretical context, each of the pieces included in <i>Object Gardens</i> works to cultivate its own form of hyperobjective worldbuilding. In this way, Object Gardens aims to grapple with the trash of the Anthropocene and rewrite its rules into what cyberfeminist scholar Donna Haraway refers to as a ‚Äùmuch better SF game.‚Äù And it is within the decaying virtual worlds that compose this exhibition, where one can chip and shred and layer like a ‚Äúmad gardener‚Äù to imagine ‚Äúa much hotter compost pile for still possible pasts, presents, and futures.‚Äù[2]
