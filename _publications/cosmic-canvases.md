excerpt: 'This is an upcoming chapter that examines a growing trend where indie horror game developers are appropriating the iconography and visual style of visual artists who have been historically associated with cosmic horror and weird fiction. I align this practice with the legacy of the games-as-art debate and scholarship on the cultural legitimation of games as well as research on how aesthetic genres are defined and changed over time.'

<b>Abstract:</b> In recent years, indie horror game developers have increasingly adopted the distinctive visual styles of H.R. Giger and Zdzis≈Çaw Beksi≈Ñski, artists whose surreal and grotesque works have become closely associated with Lovecraftian horror. This essay uses the first-person horror adventure game <i>Scorn</i> (Ebb Software, 2022) as a primary case study to analyze how independent developers are explicitly leveraging these artists' aesthetics not only to establish an atmosphere of cosmic dread but also to legitimize their games within the broader Lovecraftian horror game subgenre. Drawing on fan studies (Bailey & Dolan, forthcoming; Mullis, 2015), paratextual media studies (Seiwald, 2023; Wright, 2018), art history (Young, 2021), and independent and horror game studies (Thon, 2020), I argue that these developers strategically use Giger and Beksi≈Ñski‚Äôs recognizable styles as visual paratexts‚Äîsignifiers that appeal to Lovecraftian horror fans and reinforce a shared understanding of what "counts" as Lovecraftian in the realm of game design. This practice, in turn, helps solidify Giger and Beksi≈Ñski's posthumous association with Lovecraftian horror, shaping the visual language of the genre in ways that transcend their original artistic intentions. By analyzing the creative choices and marketing strategies behind these titles, this essay reveals how indie games are not only adapting but actively constructing the visual canon of Lovecraftian horror, blurring the lines between artistic homage and genre consolidation.
