A second-year undergraduate in-person lecture focused on introducing the field of game studies to students. Assessment methods included a reading response, an essay proposal (and accompanying annotated bibliography), key term quizzes, a game analysis essay (written or recorded/video), and a final research essay (written or recorded/video).

<b>Course Summary:</b> Games studies views games as complex objects, mapping the game 'object', the player 'subject' and the critical dialogue that delimits game space. This course explores games as cultural artifacts, arising from diverse cultural histories, landscapes and geographies, impacting and impacted by sub-cultures. Students will learn to analyse the mechanics, aesthetics and practices of games via varied analytical approaches addressing their textual, performative, socio-cultural, design and political contexts. As well, the course introduces students to tools and techniques to analyze the cultural impact of the videogame.
