A third-year undergraduate in-person lecture focused on introducing the field of game studies to students. Assessment methods included reading presentations, a weekly game analysis journal, a project proposal, an annotated bibliography, and a final research production project (game prototype, podcast, or video essay).

<b>Course Summary</b> This course explores many of the significant theories, perspectives, and debates that have arisen within the field of game studies since its inception during the early 2000s. Every week, students will learn new methods for critically analyzing videogames and their surrounding culture using a wide variety of theoretical frameworks (ecocritical, queer, postcolonial, crip, anti-capitalist, etc.). In addition to reviewing key game studies texts, every week, students will engage in/with critical playthroughs of a selection of conceptually relevant games. By the end of the course, students will come away with a diverse toolkit of techniques and language for understanding the unique formal, aesthetic, narrative, and thematic properties of videogames in a variety of platforms and genres.
