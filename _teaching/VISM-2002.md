A second-year undergraduate online lecture focused on introducing the history of new media art to students. Assessment methods included reading responses, key term quizzes, a visual analysis essay (written or recorded/video), and a final take-home exam.

<b>Course Summary:</b> This survey course offers a history of the relationship of art and media from the beginnings of photography and avant-garde cinema to contemporary digital and video art practices. The course examines technological developments that have affected and transformed perception and representation including time-motion studies, industrialization (Taylorism), mass culture, and global electronic networks (Internet). The influence of new media on various avant-garde movements including cubism, constructivism, surrealism, dada, and on the stylistic innovations of collage and montage will be explored. Selected writings on art and technology by key thinkers of the twentieth century will complement a visual and intellectual survey of artworks.
