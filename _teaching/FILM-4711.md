A fourth-year undergraduate in-person seminar focused on the politics of film archiving. Assessment methods included reading presentations, graded discussion boards, a project proposal, a Zotero-based annotated bibliography, and a final research production project (zine, online exhibition, podcast, or video essay).

<b>Course Summary:</b> What role do moving image archives play in shaping history, memory, and the future? This course examines recent efforts to decolonize institutional archives, critically interrogate digital archives and platforms, build community archives, and create counter-archives. This course provides a theoretical overview of archival theory and an introduction to methodological aspects of critical archival studies and media studies research. Throughout the course, students will be presented with a variety of media archives and work to critically examine the ethical implications of their use. At the end of the course, students will have the opportunity to create an archival media production assignment in a medium of their choice (video, website, zine, game, etc.).
