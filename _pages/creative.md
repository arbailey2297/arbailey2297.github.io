# üñºÔ∏è Curation

Below are photographs from a recent exhibition I curated at <b>PAVED Arts</b> in Saskatoon in Summer 2023 titled [<b><i>Object Gardens</i></b>](https://www.pavedarts.ca/programming/object-gardens/). Participating artists included Guggenheim fellow [<b>Peter Burr</b>](https://www.peterburr.org/) (USA), 2018 EQ Bank Emerging Digital Artist Award winner [<b>Anna Eyler</b>](http://aenl.net/) and her partner and collaborator [<b>Nicolas Lapointe</b>](http://aenl.net/) (CAD), and Venice Biennale-presenting artist [<b>Jakob Kudsk Steensen</b>](https://www.jakobsteensen.com/) (DNK).<br><br> [<b>Click here to see more photos and read the curatorial essay for the exhibition that was published in PAVED Meant Vol 5(2024)</b>.](https://arbailey2297.github.io/files/object-gardens%20essay.pdf)

Below is a photograph of a recent exhibition I coordinated and produced at the [<b>Archives of Ontario</b>](https://www.archives.gov.on.ca/en/index.aspx) in Summer 2023 titled [<b><i>Margaret Perry: A Life in Film</i></b>](https://counterarchive.ca/margaret-perry-life-film-exhibit-archives-ontario). The traveling exhibition was originally put on at the <b>Nova Scotia Archives</b> and curated by <b>Jennifer VanerBurgh</b> (St. Mary's University) and <b>Carla Taunton</b> (NSCAD), and I collaborated with them to recreate it at the Archives of Ontario as a part of that year's Congress of the Social Sciences and Humanities at York University.
