# üóÉÔ∏è Playful Records

As part of my current SSHRC postdoctoral research project, I am working on a monograph titled <b><i>Playful Records: Counter-Archival Game Art and Videogame Collections</i></b> that is under contract with <b>Amsterdam University Press</b> for its <b>‚ÄúGames and Play‚Äù</b> series. This book is heavily informed by the curatorial and archival research I conducted during my previous Mitacs Accelerate postdoc with the SSHRC Partnership Grant project, <b>Archive/Counter-Archive</b>. If there are no delays in finishing the manuscript or the review process, this book will likely be published in mid to late 2026.

The other half of my SSHRC postdoc consists of using the open-source tool <b>CollectionBuilder</b> to produce a pedagogically-oriented digital archive focused on award-winning game <b><i>Celeste</i></b> (Maddy Makes Games, 2018) and the career of its director, writer, and co-programmer, <b>Maddy Thorson</b>. Featuring an emotional narrative about a trans woman‚Äôs mental health struggles, Celeste has fostered a vibrant queer fan community of speedrunners, modders, and artists. By assembling an archive of paratexts produced by these communities alongside a variety of developer-created material, one of my project‚Äôs primary goals is to provide tools for game studies scholars to teach Canadian videogame history more easily. This archive is currently under development and I am aiming to publish an initial prototype in late 2025 or early 2026.

# üñºÔ∏è Media Art Curation

Below are photographs from a recent exhibition I curated at <b>PAVED Arts</b> in Saskatoon in Summer 2023 titled [<b><i>Object Gardens</i></b>](https://www.pavedarts.ca/programming/object-gardens/). Participating artists included Guggenheim fellow [<b>Peter Burr</b>](https://www.peterburr.org/) (USA), 2018 EQ Bank Emerging Digital Artist Award winner [<b>Anna Eyler</b>](http://aenl.net/) and her partner and collaborator [<b>Nicolas Lapointe</b>](http://aenl.net/) (CAD), and Venice Biennale-presenting artist [<b>Jakob Kudsk Steensen</b>](https://www.jakobsteensen.com/) (DNK).<br><br> [<b>Click here to see more photos and read the curatorial essay for the exhibition that was published in PAVED Meant Vol 5(2024)</b>.](https://arbailey2297.github.io/files/object-gardens%20essay.pdf)

Below is a photograph of a recent exhibition I coordinated and produced at the [<b>Archives of Ontario</b>](https://www.archives.gov.on.ca/en/index.aspx) in Summer 2023 titled [<b><i>Margaret Perry: A Life in Film</i></b>](https://counterarchive.ca/margaret-perry-life-film-exhibit-archives-ontario). The traveling exhibition was originally put on at the <b>Nova Scotia Archives</b> and curated by <b>Jennifer VanderBurgh</b> (St. Mary's University) and <b>Carla Taunton</b> (NSCAD), and I collaborated with them to recreate it at the Archives of Ontario as a part of that year's Congress of the Social Sciences and Humanities at York University.

# üßä 3D Modelling
As part of my ongoing research into <b>the Haunted PS1 independent game development community</b> and the low-poly 3D modelling and chunky photo-based texturing it is known for, I have been slowly creating a collection of similar low-poly game assets in Blender. My selection of objects to model is also informed by my ongoing interest in <b>ecocritical game art</b> and <b>how games like Animal Crossing have approached collecting as a game mechanic</b>. In keeping with my interest in game archives, I am also planning on submitting this collection once it is done to <b>Miziziziz'z "The Big Collection of Commercially Usable Retro 3D Style Assets."</b><br/>

# üìê Graphic Design

A selection of promotional assets (posters, slides, social media content, etc.) that I have either directly designed or provided art direction for as a part of my time working as the Knowledge Mobilization Officer for the SSHRC Partnership Grant project [<b>Archive/Counter-Archive</b>](https://counterarchive.ca/welcome).<br/>

These are a couple of posters that I created for screenings that were curated by [<b>ANGURA!</b>](https://angura.tumblr.com/), a Japanese experimental art/film collective that programs screenings/exhibitions in Toronto, Winnipeg, and Montreal.
