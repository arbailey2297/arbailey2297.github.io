# 🖼️ Curation

Below are photographs from a recent exhibition I curated at <b>PAVED Arts</b> in Saskatoon in Summer 2023 titled [<b><i>Object Gardens</i></b>](https://www.pavedarts.ca/programming/object-gardens/). Participating artists included Guggenheim fellow [<b>Peter Burr</b>](https://www.peterburr.org/) (USA), 2018 EQ Bank Emerging Digital Artist Award winner [<b>Anna Eyler</b>](http://aenl.net/) and her partner and collaborator [<b>Nicolas Lapointe</b>](http://aenl.net/) (CAD), and Venice Biennale-presenting artist [<b>Jakob Kudsk Steensen</b>](https://www.jakobsteensen.com/) (DNK).<br/>

Below is a photograph of a recent exhibition I coordinated and produced at the [<b>Archives of Ontario</b>](https://www.archives.gov.on.ca/en/index.aspx) in Summer 2023 titled [<b><i>Margaret Perry: A Life in Film</i></b>](https://counterarchive.ca/margaret-perry-life-film-exhibit-archives-ontario). The traveling exhibition was originally put on at the <b>Nova Scotia Archives</b> and curated by <b>Jennifer VanerBurgh</b> (St. Mary's University) and <b>Carla Taunton</b> (NSCAD), and I collaborated with them to recreate it at the Archives of Ontario as a part of that year's Congress of the Social Sciences and Humanities at York University.

# 📐 Design

A selection of promotional assets (posters, slides, social media content, etc.) that I have either directly designed or provided art direction for as a part of my time working as the Knowledge Mobilization Officer for the SSHRC Partnership Grant project [<b>Archive/Counter-Archive</b>](https://counterarchive.ca/welcome).<br/>

These are a couple of posters that I created for screenings that were curated by [<b>ANGURA!</b>](https://angura.tumblr.com/), a Japanese experimental art/film collective that programs screenings/exhibitions in Toronto, Winnipeg, and Montreal.
