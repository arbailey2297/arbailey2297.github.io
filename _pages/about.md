I am an interdisciplinary scholar, curator, and artist interested in the relationship between videogames, art, and history. 

I have a PhD in [Art History and Visual Culture](https://www.yorku.ca/gradstudies/ahvc/programs/phd/) from York University (Toronto), with a dissertation focused on [how videogames were produced, defined, and exhibited as art throughout the 2000s and 2010s](https://yorkspace.library.yorku.ca/server/api/core/bitstreams/79982f61-383e-4dd8-b02f-02d349f093c3/content). 

I am currently a Mitacs Accelerate Postdoctoral Fellow with the SSHRC Partnership Grant Project ["Archive/Counter-Archive"](https://counterarchive.ca), where I research the knowledge mobilization utility of hybrid media platforms such as [Manifold](https://manifoldapp.org/) and [VUCAVU](https://vucavu.com/en/home) in the context of Canadian short film and experimental cinema. As part of this postdoctoral work, I frequently engage in scholarly event coordination, curatorial programming, and grant writing.

This fall, I will start a two-year SSHRC Postdoctoral Fellowship with the Technoculture, Art, and Games Centre at Concordia University with a project focused on producing pedagogically oriented digital archives of Canadian independent game development. 

I also work as a sessional instructor at OCAD University, McMaster University, and York University, teaching various courses related to game studies, critical archival studies, communications, film and media studies, and art history.

🎮 My Current Research
======
My current research fits loosely into three distinct categories
* Producing a digital archive and corresponding monograph focused on Maddy Thorson, the Canadian independent game developer best known for the award-winning platformer <i>Celeste</i> (EXOK Games, 2018).
* Writing articles on [the Haunted PS1 game development community](https://the-official-haunted-ps1.fandom.com/wiki/The_Official_Haunted_PS1_Wiki) and the nostalgic low-poly horror aesthetics that they produce. This research has largely been conducted with my collaborator [Patrick Dolan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-r-dolan/) (York University).
* Exploring the various ways that videogames can be used as a unique form of digital archive through examples such as historical folk horror games and playable comic collections.

🗂️ My Professional Background
======
Outside of postdoctoral and teaching work, I also have significant work experience in the following areas:
* Arts administration, programming, and exhibition design with several Toronto commercial galleries and artist-run centres
* Editing for multiple academic arts/media journals
* Print production in commercial textile screenprinting and fine art giclée printing studios
* Studio assistance for a professional visual artist, helping to prepare work for international solo exhibitions at commercial art galleries
* Freelance graphic and web design, creating event posters, album covers, book layouts, websites, t-shirt designs, editorial illustrations, etc.

🎨 My Creative Practice
======
I am a formally trained printmaker and curator and have also taught myself a number of skills related to digital art and game development. I currently have expertise and/or am in the process of learning the following tools, techniques, and programs:
* Flat-colour and halftone CMYK screen-printing
* Zine-making and book arts
* Digital drawing and collage in Photoshop and GIMP
* RenPy-based game development and Python coding
* Unity-based game development and C# coding
* Twine and Bitsy-based game development and HTML coding
* 3D modeling in Blender
* Pixel art using Aesprite and Playscii
