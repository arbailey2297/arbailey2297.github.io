I am an interdisciplinary scholar, curator, and artist interested in the relationship between videogames, art, and history. 

I am currently a SSHRC Postdoctoral Fellowship with the [Technoculture, Art, and Games Research Lab](https://tag.hexagram.ca/) at Concordia University with a project focused on producing pedagogically oriented digital archives of Canadian independent game development and game art. 

I also work as a sessional instructor at OCAD University, McMaster University, and York University, teaching various courses related to game studies, critical archival studies, communications, film and media studies, and art history.

I have a PhD in Art History and Visual Culture from York University (Toronto), with a dissertation focused on [how videogames were produced, defined, and exhibited as art throughout the 2000s and 2010s](https://yorkspace.library.yorku.ca/server/api/core/bitstreams/79982f61-383e-4dd8-b02f-02d349f093c3/content). 

üéÆ My Current Research
======
My current research fits loosely into three distinct categories
* Producing a digital archive and corresponding monograph focused on [Maddy Thorson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maddy_Thorson), the Canadian independent game developer best known for the award-winning platformer <i>Celeste</i> (EXOK Games, 2018).
* Writing articles on [the Haunted PS1 game development community](https://arbailey2297.github.io/publication/ghastly-graphics) and the nostalgic low-poly horror aesthetics that they produce. This research has largely been conducted with my collaborator [Patrick Dolan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-r-dolan/) (York University).
* Exploring the various ways that videogames relate to real-world archives and art historical artifacts through examples such as [historical folk horror games](https://arbailey2297.github.io/publication/devious-archive) and [fictional recreations of Nam June Paik's artwork](https://arbailey2297.github.io/publication/half-light-histories).

üóÇÔ∏è My Professional Background
======
Outside of my scholarly research and teaching work, I also have significant work experience in the following areas:
* Arts administration, programming, and exhibition design with several Toronto commercial galleries and artist-run centres
