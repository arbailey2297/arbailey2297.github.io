I am an interdisciplinary scholar, curator, and artist working out of Toronto in Canada. 

I am currently a SSHRC Postdoctoral Fellowship with the [Technoculture, Art, and Games Research Lab](https://tag.hexagram.ca/) at Concordia University with a project focused on devising new theoretical frameworks and research-creation methods for exploring the relationship between videogames, art, history, and archives. 

I also have worked as a sessional instructor at OCAD University, McMaster University, and York University, teaching various courses related to game studies, critical archival studies, communications, film and media studies, and art history.

I have a PhD in Art History and Visual Culture from York University (Toronto), with a dissertation focused on [how videogames were defined and exhibited as art throughout the 2000s and 2010s](https://yorkspace.library.yorku.ca/server/api/core/bitstreams/79982f61-383e-4dd8-b02f-02d349f093c3/content). 

üéÆ My Current Research
======
My current research fits loosely into three distinct categories. You can find more detail on [my Publications page.](https://arbailey2297.github.io/publications/)
* Writing a monograph that explores the various ways that videogames engage with real-world archives and art historical artifacts through examples such as [historical folk horror games](https://arbailey2297.github.io/publication/devious-archive) and [fictional recreations of Nam June Paik's artwork](https://arbailey2297.github.io/publication/half-light-histories).
* Producing a pedagogically-oriented digital archive of paratexts and corresponding publications related to the Canadian queer indie game <i>Celeste</i> (EXOK Games, 2018) and its director, writer, and co-porgrammer [Maddy Thorson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maddy_Thorson).
* Writing articles on how retro independent horror game development is comprised of novel communities of practice and tool fandoms through examples such as [the Haunted PS1 Render Pipeline community](https://arbailey2297.github.io/publication/ghastly-graphics) and Lilith Walthers' [<i>Bloodborne PSX Demake</i>](https://arbailey2297.github.io/publication/bloodborne-psx).
